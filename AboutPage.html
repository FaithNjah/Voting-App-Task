            <h1 class="aboutUs">ABOUT US</h1>
            Since 1914, The Best Tech Lord (BTL) Award has recognized outstanding achievers, creatives, innovators and exceptional product owners in the US tech industry. Becoming a stage for the bold celebration of the various game changers and brilliant minds doing magic to create a technologically advanced world where future generations are exposed to limitless and inclusive opportunities.
            Silicon Valley tech executives, Faith, Godwin, Funmi, Godwin and Abidemi  teamed up to organise this iconic annual virtual competition all over the 50 states of the united states. BTL encourages every tech guru to recognise, nominate and vote in the Tech Lord of the year and also inspires past and future tech enthusiasts to join in the voting process. Transparency is at the core of the BTL Voting process, we do this by building a voting system in which every voter has access to monitor all voting activities throughout the county.
